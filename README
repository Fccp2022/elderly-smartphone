# Elderly-Friendly Smartphone Project

## Introduction
This is an open-source project aimed at creating a smartphone tailored for elderly users (65+ years old). The phone features voice interaction, simple navigation, and large-font UI. It is built around the ESP32 microcontroller with custom PCB design and a 3D-printed enclosure.

## Key Features
- **Dedicated EMS button**: Links to local EMS services with one press.
- **Voice dialing**: Supports various dialects and accented Mandarin.
- **Simple navigation**: Physical buttons for power and page navigation.
- **Large font display**: Ensures readability for elderly users.

## Hardware
This project provides two hardware options:
1. **Pre-built hardware**: Customize firmware on existing smartphones.
2. **Custom PCB**: Design based on ESP32, GSM/LTE module, and audio interfaces.

## Software
The software includes voice recognition for various dialects, and a basic phone functionality implementation using ESP32.
